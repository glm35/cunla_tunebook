Subject: abc2ly: Several problems with alternatives

> I'm not top posting.

I have a few problems about repeats and alternatives with abc2ly in
lilypond 2.11.28.


Problem 1: bar missing before the first alternative

X:1
T:Bar missing before the first alternative
K:C
M:C
|: C4 E4 |1 G4 B4 :|2 G4 A4 |

In lilypond postscript output, there is no bar between measure 1 and
measure 2.


Problem 2: invalid abc2ly output when a new repeat follows a
repeat/alternative sequence

X:1
T:Invalid conversion of repeat/alternative/repeat sequence
K:C
M:C
|: C4 E4 |1 G4 B4 :|2 G4 A4
|: D4 F4 | A4 c4 :|

In abc2ly output, the alternative block is not closed before the second
repeat block is opened: the second repeat block is nested in the second
part of the alternative block. This generates a compilation error with
lilypond.


Problem 3: alternative block not closed before the end of the tune

X:1
T:Second alternative not closed before the end of the tune
K:C
M:C
|: C4 E4 |1 G4 B4 :|2 G4 A4
| B8 | c8 | d8 | e8 |

In this example, in lilypond postscript output, the second alternative
line over the staff spans until the end of the tune. This is not
incorrect, but this is not really what I expect: I expect the second
alternative to last as long as the first one.

PS: I have some patches that fix these problems for me. I'll post them
to lilypond-devel.
